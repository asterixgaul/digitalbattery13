# digitalbattery13
<b>DigitalBattery13</b>
Provides a digital percentage in the StatusBar for all notched devices (like the good old days), and on older devices with modernstatusbar tweaks.

<b>Setup</b>
To use this tweak simply install it, it is enabled by default.
Navigate to the Settings app and look for DigitalBattery13, tap to open and choose the settings you wish to personalise.

Current settings:
-Respring
-Enable (tweak on/off)
-Style battery options (Digital percentage, apples methods)
-Font options (because not all devices are alike)
-Tap gestures (2 tap LPM toggle, 2sec longpress respring)
-Color options (iOS defaults when left unchanged, most efficient)
-Support

<b>Important information</b>
You must respring after changing any or all settings for changes to take effect.
DigitalBattery13 is optimised for iOS13, it will not install on older versions.
You will need to add the repo for the colorpicker library prior to installing (https://creaturesurvive.github.io/)
